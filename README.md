# **Star Wars Quizapp - A milestone project**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, the Starwars Quiz app.

I had great success with my first milestone project, Project Sikhism. In my second milestone project, I have tried to expand on 
my knowledge with the hope to create a more interactive experience for users. 

This project will hopefully show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript. Combining JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
I aim to create an interactive quiz app based on Star Wars.

A large part of the inspiration for this project comes from my love for the Star Wars Universe, and the success of the current TV series, The Mandalorian.
I hope fellow Star Wars fans enjoy the project.

I will outline the steps taken and the philosophy behind the project, from the planning of the project to the development. 

Thank you for viewing this project, I hope you enjoy my attempt at a quiz app.

May the force be with you!

## **UXD – User Experience Design**
To help with development, I followed Jason James Garrett’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. 

The goal of every project should be the provide a positive emotional experience for the user. As developers, it can be easy to get off track with implementations of features, which in theory may seem great, but can cause confusion for users interacting with the project.

The planning and development of the project is split into 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

I will explain in detail each Planes process of development.

## **Strategy Plane**

The Strategy Plane consists of coming up with an idea to help us to better understand the goals of the project.  I focused on coming up with creator goals, first-time visitor goals, and returning visitor goals.

### **Creator Stories** ###

**Creator Goals**, 

- As a creator, I would like the typography in the project to look fun and engaging yet easy to read.

- As a creator, I want to use original imagery in the hero image to invoke a positive emotional response. Particularly from fans of the star wars universe.

- As a creator, I want the project to be responsive across different resolutions.

- As a creator, I would like to add star wars characters to the high score page, so the user feels like they are competing with characters from the star wars universe.

- As a creator, I would like to add interactive elements outside of the game, potentially adding an alternative to dark/light mode, but with Jedi/Sith colors instead.

Having established clear goals for what I would like to achieve with the project as a creator, I did some research amongst friends and fans to better establish what users would like from the project.

### **User Stories** ###

**First-time visitor goals**, 

- As a first-time visitor, I want some introduction to help me understand the purpose of the project.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to navigate to the relevant section I am looking for without having to scroll.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to see some instructions on how to play, before starting the game.

- As a first-time visitor, I would like to see some familiarity with the movies, with either sounds or images.

- As a first-time visitor, I would like to select an answer and know if I selected the correct or incorrect answer with a visual response.

**Returning visitor goals**,

- As a returning visitor, I would like to have my scores saved per session.

- As a returning visitor, I would like to have a way to contact the creator, to provide feedback, or bring attention to any bugs.

From my Creator goals and User stories, it is much easier to understand what features are important to add for a positive user experience versus what I may believe the user would like to see.

As a creator with clearer guidelines, I am better equipped to come up with a design for the project, and plan what the first deployed version would look like, and what features I can add later to enhance the project later.

In the Scope Plane, I will go into more detail about the planning process for the project.
