## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, the Starwars Quiz app.

I had great success with my first milestone project, Project Sikhism. In my second milestone project, I have tried to expand on 
my knowledge with the hope to create a more interactive experience for users. 

This project will hopefully show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript. Combining JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
I aim to create an interactive quiz app based on Star Wars.

A large part of the inspiration for this project comes from my love for the Star Wars Universe, and the success of the current TV series, The Mandalorian.
I hope fellow Star Wars fans enjoy the project.

I will outline the steps taken and the philosophy behind the project, from the planning of the project to the development. 

Thank you for viewing this project, I hope you enjoy my attempt at a quiz app.

May the force be with you!

## **UXD – User Experience Design**
To help with development, I followed Jason James Garrett’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. 

The goal of every project should be the provide a positive emotional experience for the user. As developers, it can be easy to get off track with implementations of features, which in theory may seem great, but can cause confusion for users interacting with the project.

The planning and development of the project is split into 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

I will explain in detail each Planes process of development.

---

## **Strategy Plane**

The Strategy Plane consists of coming up with an idea to help us to better understand the goals of the project.  I focused on coming up with creator goals, first-time visitor goals, and returning visitor goals.

### **Creator Stories** ###

**Creator Goals**, 

- As a creator, I would like the typography in the project to look fun and engaging yet easy to read.

- As a creator, I want to use original imagery in the hero image to invoke a positive emotional response. Particularly from fans of the star wars universe.

- As a creator, I want the project to be responsive across different resolutions.

Having established clear goals for what I would like to achieve with the project as a creator, I did some research amongst friends and fans to better establish what users would like from the project.

### **User Stories** ###

**First-time visitor goals**, 

- As a first-time visitor, I want some introduction to help me understand the purpose of the project.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to navigate to the relevant section I am looking for without having to scroll.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to see some instructions on how to play, before starting the game.

- As a first-time visitor, I would like to see some familiarity with the movies, with either sounds or images.

- As a first-time visitor, I would like to select an answer and know if I selected the correct or incorrect answer with a visual response.

**Returning visitor goals**,

- As a returning visitor, I would like to have my scores saved per session.

From my Creator goals and User stories, it is much easier to understand what features are important to add for a positive user experience versus what I may believe the user would like to see.

As a creator with clearer guidelines, I am better equipped to come up with a design for the project, and plan what the first deployed version would look like, and what features I can add later to enhance the project later.

In the Scope Plane, I will go into more detail about the planning process for the project.

---

## **Scope Plane**

My biggest issue creating the project with the goals I had was whether I could build the project with the lack
of experience I had using JavaScript. This is my first project using JavaScript, and timescale was definitely going to be a 
factor when dealing with issues and bugs.

I decided to start with a minimal viable product on release, allowing me to start gathering feedback. A phased release with additional features would allow me to keep adding features to the project, and keep the project
engaging for returning visitors

My plan for a phased release is 

**Phase 1**

- A simple Home Page, with a navigation menu at the top, and sections for features and instructions.
- A small introduction so the User can understand what the project is. 
- Clear and visible links to the game and highscores pages.
- A simple quiz layout that is easy to understand and use. 
- A final page where the User can save their score, navigate back home or play again. 

**Phase 2**

- Expansion to the quiz with new questions.
- A way for the User to be able to change the colors of the quiz page, perhaps being able to change the colors to red/blue to represent the Sith/Jedi.
- Iconic scrolling text from the movies, to begin the quiz to bring a more nostalgic feeling for fans.

**Phase 3** 

- A contact section for Users to leave feedback and suggestions.
- Game sounds for Users when they select correct/incorrect answers.
- Add characters from the movies to the high scores page, to give the impression to the user they are competing with characters from the movies.

## **Structure Plane**

**Colors**

![Star Wars Logo ](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/StarWars-Quizapp/blob/master/assets/images/starwars-heroimage.png)


Before starting the project, I wanted to use the original Star Wars logo as my hero image. As a fan of the franchise, I understand what it meant to me and what it meant to other fans. I used the Yellow/Black color combination throughout the project, and just added white as a contrasting color. I felt the color combination
of White/Black/Yellow was simple and clean. 

I have always been one who prefers Dark Mode on browsers when available. I decided to keep the Black background throughout the project while using Yellow/White as font colors.

**Typography**

The fonts I chose for this project are Luckiest Guy and Roboto. 
Roboto personally looks very modern, very easy on the eyes, and simple to read. It isn't too distracting and doesn't take away from the other contents on the page.
Luckiest Guy is a new font I had never used before. I wanted to use a font that was bold, engaging, and fun. And this font definitely stood out as a great font to use as a header 
and contrast to Roboto. 

![Fonts used](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/StarWars-Quizapp/blob/master/documentation/fonts.png)

The project overall is responsive across different resolutions, I decided to add CSS media queries to make the fonts on the quiz page smaller to keep all the content on a single page without the need to scroll.

I used Bootstrap as the main framework to help the project stay responsive. Bootstrap is a framework I am becoming a lot more familiar with, Bootstraps built-in class's allowed me to spend more time on
the aspects of the project that required more attention.

I wanted to add a footer section to the home page. I wanted to keep it simple and just added standard copyright text and used font awesome icons to link to the associated social media page.

## **Skeleton Plane**

Below is a link to the project wireframes.

[Project Wireframes](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/StarWars-Quizapp/blob/master/documentation/wireframes.pdf "Star Wars Quiz App Wireframes.")

For this project, I tried to stay as close to the wireframes that I designed as I could, but some changes were made due mainly to my lack of JavaScript and how to implement certain features
and some changes that I had originally overlooked that would be needed.

**Home Page**

- The home page remained relatively the same as designed in the Wireframes. The only change that I added was I added a High Scores button that links to the High Scores page. 
This was an oversight on my part when designing the wireframes and was something I added during development.

**Quiz Page**

- On the Quiz Page, I made two changes. 
    - I decided to remove the Footer section on the Quiz Page. During development, I realized it didn't make much sense for the User, why would the User click a social link in the middle of the quiz. It also helped with me trying the keep the whole quiz page on one view height size of the page, without the need of the user having to scroll down.
    - Instead of a timer text in the top left, I changed it more to a progress section, that gave the user information on how many questions are remaining. This was due to me struggling with JavaScript and correctly being able to implement 
    the timer with my lack of knowledge.

**Quiz Final Page** 

- This page was not included as part of the project wireframes and was not something I had considered. It was an oversight on my part, and during development, I realized I needed a page
after the user had finished the quiz. This page would provide the user with options of saving their score, playing again, going back home, and a link to the high scores page. 

**High Scores Page**

- The High Scores page stayed relatively the same as the project wireframes. Subtle changes were the removal of the footer, and the increasing the number of high scores from 4 to 6. I removed the Play Again button from the page and kept the link back to the Home Page. This was in response to feedback when sharing the project during development.  

---

## **Surface Plane**

**Features present in the Project**

- Home Page has a Navbar, the links link to the relevant sections on the Home Page. The Play Now link starts the game. 
- Navbar is responsive across different resolutions, at ``576px`` width, the Navbar changes to a hamburger menu.
- Large iconic Hero image to draw the Users attention. Most Users will immediately recognise the Star Wars logo, which hopefully encourages to have a go at playing the game.
- Dark background throughout the project to give the effect of a Dark Mode theme.
- Selected answers will respond with relevant color changes to reflect the response. Correct answers will be colored Green / Incorrect answers will be colored Red.
- Users can save their high score by saving a name. Score and Name are saved in browser local storage, and can be viewed on the High Score page.
- Score updates with every answer selected. Correct scores award 100 points, Inscorrect scores give 0 with a maximum of 1000 avaibale at the end.

**Features to be implemeneted in the Future**

- Timer for Users to select an answer, if no answer is slected then it moves to the next question.
- Sound effects as the User interacts with the project, Coorect answers has a certain sound and Incorrect answers have a different sound.
- The scrolling text from the movies to act as an intro before the quiz starts would be a great user expereince, espescially for fans of the Star Wars Franchise.
- Further ways for Users to customize the interface. Ability to change to color of certain containers, dark/light mode etc.

## **Testing**

**User Story Testing**

[Returning Visitor Goals](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/StarWars-Quizapp/blob/master/documentation/returning-goals.pdf)

**Further Testing**

The project was deployed early to gather feedback throughout developement and find bugs, I used Chrome Dev Tools to help test responsiveness.
Chrome Dev Tools used to emulate the following devices,
- Apple Ipad
- Apple Ipad Pro
- Microsoft Surface Duo
- Motorola G4
- Samsung Galaxy S5
- Google Pixel 2/2 XL
- Apple iPhone 5/SE
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- Apple iPhone XL

The project was manually tested on the Iphone 11 and Samsung A70.

The project was tested on the following browsers,
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera

I used the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to validate my HTML and CSS. All errors were corrected.

I used JSHint to check my JavaScript code, All errors were corrected. 
- One warning which may show on the quiz-end.js page is due to the function relating to the save button is called in the quiz-end.html file.

Due to time constraints and a lack of experience, I was unable to effectively unit test my JavaScript. My workaround to this was to simply try a trial and error method to test whether my functions correctly worked.
I used some tutorial videos to give me an idea of the functions that would be required and to understand the logic. 

I have to formally apologize if the JavaScript code may look like spaghetti, but my first attempt at trying a more object-orientated approach did not net the results I expected. This again is more due to a lack of experience and understanding of JavaScript. 

I started all my Javascript files with a process in mind, 
- Create Variables for the HTML elements.
- Write functions relating to the intracting elements.

My method for testing my functions was simple process of trial and error. I tried to write my functions, save and check the results. If the desired result did not come about my process was,
- Check Chrome dev tools for any errors in the console. 
    - Finding errors in the console was the easiest starting point. It gave me a clear indication of where the errors was. 
- If the Dev Tools console gave no error, and the functions still did not work, I re-checked the function. 
- At this point I normally would look for advice, fortunately I had some friends who were able to aid me by pointing me in the direction of why the functions were not providing the desired results.

This method worked for a simple project like this, but something I would definately like to try is to attempt some unit testing with JavaScript in the future.

**Known Bugs and Fixes**

- JShint Code parsing.
    - My first time parsing my code through JShint came with many errors. Many of these errors were corrected with the use of ``/*jshint esversion: 6 */``. 
    - I also had errors relating to functions and variables not being defined and missing semi-colons, these errors were correct with the use of ``let`` and adding the ``;`.
    - Credit to these fixes goes to, Aaron Sinnot, my mentor and Kotaro TANAKA, from Slack.
- Error 404 when clicking the save button, to save score.
    - I wasn't having the issue in my IDE because during development, but Users were getting directed to a non existing page when clicking save. 
    - I fixed the function relating to the save button by adding ``window.location.assign(`https://harry-leepz.github.io/StarWars-Quizapp/quiz-end.html`);`` to redirect back to the same page when Users click save.
- Users were having to click the text in the quiz page, clicking anywhere except for the text would not trigger the event listner function. 
    - Gave the CSS class for the answer content ``width: 100%;`` to make it the same width as the parent element.

Alot of the Issues I encountered during development was due to my lack of expereince working with JavaScript. I made the mistake of using camelcase when naming variables, but not using camel case when referring to them in functions which caused some issues. 
Also I made the mistake of using the ability to highlight and "Change all occurences" options of Gitpod, which caused some issue during development.

    - Friends of mine who have a lot more expereince working with JavaScript. At times when things were tough I lent on them for support and guidance. And this project would not be close to what it is without them.
- Aaron Sinnott 
    - My mentor, offering great guidance and helped with errors I was getting relating to JShint.

- Final note on what seems like a very very project. 
    - I started this project eager and excited at the prospect of working on a simple quiz game based on a franchise I love. Going into Christmas we were told to evacuate our home due to flood issues. We went into our 3rd lockdown as a nation when we were excited to finally see
    our family during Christmas. And the tragic news when we found out my Uncle had passed having a 11 day battle in hospital with Covid.
    - This is by no means the neatest or cleanest piece of code written espescially pertaining to JavaScript. But it was the best I could do, and to my family and friends who kept pushing to go forwards, Thank you. 

Thank you for viewing this project, and I hope you enjoy the quiz. And whoever you are and where ever you are, *May the force be with you!.*
