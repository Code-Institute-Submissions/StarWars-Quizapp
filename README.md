## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, the Starwars Quiz app.

I had great success with my first milestone project, Project Sikhism. In my second milestone project, I have tried to expand on 
my knowledge with the hope to create a more interactive experience for users. 

This project will hopefully show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript. Combining JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
I aim to create an interactive quiz app based on Star Wars.

A large part of the inspiration for this project comes from my love for the Star Wars Universe, and the success of the current TV series, The Mandalorian.
I hope fellow Star Wars fans enjoy the project.

I will outline the steps taken and the philosophy behind the project, from the planning of the project to the development. 

Thank you for viewing this project, I hope you enjoy my attempt at a quiz app.

May the force be with you!
